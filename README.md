Research Project LSTM: Money Laundering Detection
This repository contains the code, dataset preprocessing steps, and the LSTM-based model developed for detecting money laundering transactions. This project was part of my summer research focused on building a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify suspicious transactions within a financial dataset.

Overview
The primary objective of this research was to detect fraudulent money laundering transactions using the IBM AML transaction dataset. Given the nature of the dataset and the problem at hand, LSTM networks were chosen for their ability to capture patterns in sequential data, which is critical for understanding the flow of financial transactions over time.

Future Work
This project has primarily focused on applying LSTM to the task of transaction classification, but future work could involve:

1. Exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for incorporating relational data between entities (e.g., account holders or banks).
2. Improving model robustness with hyperparameter tuning and advanced regularization techniques.
3. Implementing real-time detection using streaming data for more practical applications in the financial industry.
